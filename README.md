# Golf Together
Golf Together is a client/server application designed for multiplayer golf video games. You can play using course data for any video game. The lobby itself can host as many players as the host's PC will allow connections for. The leaderboard updates automatically and can show anywhere from 1-16 players at a time.  It will automatically scroll through the entire leaderboard regardless of how many players you wish to see at a time. Invite your friends to turn any golf video game into an online multiplayer game with Golf Together. Use the leaderboard as a source on stream to show your viewers the scores in real time.

You can also download course data for video games on the Discussions tab of this page. If you would like to add data for courses from a game we don't have, there are also instructions on how to contribute.

Golf Together is currently only compatible with Windows 10. There are no plans to adapt it to other operating systems.
