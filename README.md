# Golf Together
Golf Together is a client/server application designed specifically for multiplayer golf. The app is designed in such a way that you can add course data for any video game. The lobby itself can theoretically host as many players are the host's PC will cooperate with. The leaderboard updates automatically and can show anywhere from 1-16 players at a time.  It will automatically scroll through the entire leaderboard regardless of how many players you wish to see at a time. Invite your friends to turn any golf video game into an online multiplayer game with Golf Together.

You can also download course data for video games on the Discussions tab of this page. If you would like to add data for courses from a game we don't have, there are also instructions on how to contribute.

Golf Together is currently only compatible with Windows 10. There are no plans to adapt it to other operating systems.
